# CS 171 Final Project: Fall 2021 – Industry Baby
#### by Sara Qu, Sahana Srinivasan, and Yijiang Zhao

This is our final project that seeks to understand what popular music hits look like over time and what makes a hit (using quantitative metrics like acousticness, energy, etc.)

Our main hmtl file is index.html, and the /js folder contains our main visualization files. "Main.js" runs the visualizations that one of us made, and "sahanaVis.js" and "yijiangVis.js" act as the main files for the other two members of our group. This organization just made it easier for us to not have problematic merge conflicts or overwrrite each other. The rest of the .js files are component visualizations that we coded; no library js files are included. Similarly, style.css is the style file for one person's visualizations, and the other two files are named after their authors.

All our cleaned data is in the /data folder in our code submission.
